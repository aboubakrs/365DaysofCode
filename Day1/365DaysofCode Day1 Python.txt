                                Summary of The Session
                                -----------------------
During this first session, I retained that, although there is obviously a very large number 
of programming languages, each has its advantages and disadvantages. But it was necessary 
to choose a language of higher level, less constraining, with the syntax more readable. And 
this is where the choice of Python was made, the latter being a very modern language with 
growing popularity.

Python is a portable, dynamic, extensible, free language that allows (without imposing) a 
modular approach and object-oriented to programming. Python has been developed since 1989 
by Guido van Rossum and many volunteer contributors. 

Python is suitable for scripts of about ten lines as well as complex projects of tens of 
thousands of lines. 

Finally, Python is a language of choice for processing XML. 

There are several versions of Python namely: python 1, python2, python3. But during this 
challenge, we will install and use Py3.
